# Spaceship_Titanic-
This project is based on the Spaceship Titanic dataset, where machine learning techniques are used to predict passenger survival outcomes.Inspired by the Titanic survival prediction problem, this project applies classification algorithms to determine which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension.
